## Seattle Data

This map shows parking data in Seattle for a select week in October. Seattle has a dynamic pricing scheme where the price of parking depends in part on the expected demand for parking on that block and so the price of parking on each block varies. Seattle posts each individual parking transaction on their open data portal, which can then be aggregated to determine the average price paid and average duration on each block.
